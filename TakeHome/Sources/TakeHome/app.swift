Due to unforeseen circumstances, teachers often have to sub in for other teachers, and this creates a problem in our app as students belong to specific teachers in code. Your manager has tasked you with creating a new `Class` object that untangles the teacher and student objects. Additionally, this class object should store the book that the class is using, so that it can be referenced later.

    /// Your task is to create this model, create an `example_class` object, populate it with a teacher, book, and students. Additionally, you should remove any old code from the Teacher and Student models that is antiquated / outdated. To verify that you have successfully created this class object, print out the name of your `example_class`.
