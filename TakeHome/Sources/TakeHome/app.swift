    ///
    /// Your first task has come directly from one of the teachers in our beta test:
    ///
    /// ‚ÄúI am not sure how to assess how students did on their book. I can see that they have answers, but I‚Äôm not sure which page the answers belong to. Is this intended?‚Äù After talking with the manager, he alerts her that this feature does not currently exist yet. He tasks you with creating a view that shows how a student performed on the pages of the book in a readable manner.
    ///
    ///
    /// There is a model in the TakeHome called `Answer` . This model stores the ID of the page the student worked on, and the score the student received on that page. However, it does not store the contents of the page. For your task, you will print out the results of the first student (in the array) for all the pages he completed. We want the result to look something like this:

    /// ```
    /// Student A:
    /// Page 1: 50%
    /// Page 2: 30%
    /// Page 3: 80%
    /// Page 4: 75%
    /// ...
    /// ```
    ///
    /// You can style your table however you like, we mostly would like to see how well you are able to understand, navigate, and interact with the existing codebase in this assessment.

    ///
    /// In your second challenge, we want to open things up a bit more in a scenario:
    ///
    /// The team has been demoing the beta version of the app to teachers for the last month. In that time, they have begun to notice that teachers often swap classes a lot. Due to unforeseen circumstances, teachers often have to sub in for other teachers, and this creates a problem in our app as students belong to specific teachers in code. Your manager has tasked you with creating a new `Class` (like a classroom, not the a Swift class) object that untangles the teacher and student objects. Additionally, this class object should store the book that the class is using, so that it can be referenced later.
    ///
    ///
    /// Your task is to create this model, create an `example_class` object, populate it with a teacher, book, and students. Additionally, you should remove any old code from the Teacher and Student models that is antiquated / outdated. To verify that you have successfully created this class object, print out some of the features of your `example_class`

        //
        //  Your code goes here

    ///
    /// For your final challenge, we are going to delve into the data of the students. As seen in the assessment, example data is created for you that mimics student answers to the different pages of their book. Now that we have our Class object, we want to add a method to this class so that the teacher of the class can retrieve information related to student performance.
    ///
    /// Your task in this challenge is to create two algorithms that helps teachers glean student progress in the book. One algorithm will print all the average score from the class on a particular **page** (sorted from highest to lowest). Something like this:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// Page 3: 90%
    /// Page 1: 50%
    /// Page 2: 45%
    /// ...
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The second algorithm will show individual student data across the entire book (sorted from highest to lowest). Something like this:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// Student B: 70%
    /// Student A: 60%
    /// Student C: 40%
    /// ...
    /// ```
